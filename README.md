# Dodging-Doomsday
Simulating AI Powered Asteroid Deflection


My project simulates asteroid deflection using physics and reinforcement learning (RL). The project was developed with python and uses pygame for visuals. The code simulates gravitational attraction between the sun, planets, asteroids, and the spacecraft. Each episode the RL chooses an initial velocity (delta-v), which is then applied to the spacecraft. After the episode a reward is calculated based on the outcome. After repeated episodes, the AI agent learned the ability to deflect the asteroid.
